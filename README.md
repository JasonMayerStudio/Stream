## Stream  Admin_Dash_PoC

history irreversibly by accident.

## Running Tests
[Testing](docs/testing): How to work with the built-in test harness;

1. Sprinkle `.test.js` files directly next to the parts of your application you
   want to test. (Or in `test/` subdirectories, it doesn't really matter as long
   as they are directly next to those parts and end in `.test.js`)

1. Write your unit and component tests in those files.

1. Run `npm run test` in your terminal and see all the tests pass! (hopefully)

* AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
    tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.
